        <p>In 1010 <acr title="After Descending">AD</acr>, <strong>Raja Raja </strong>built the <cite>Brihadeswara Temple</cite> dedicated to <em>Lord Shiva</em>. The temple and the capital acted as a center of both religious, and economic activity. It is also known as <strong>Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajeswaram</strong>. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of <em>Dravidian Architecture</em> during the <strong>Chola Period</strong>. The temple turned <strong>1000</strong> years in <em>2010</em>. The temple is part of the <acr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</acr> World Heritage Site known as the <strong>"Great Living Chola Temples",</strong> with the other two being the <em>Gangaikonda Cholapuram</em> and <em>Airavateswara</em> temple. <br><br>
        The <strong>Vimanam</strong>(temple tower) is 216 ft (66 m) high and is the tallest in the world. The <strong>Kubam</strong>(the apex or the bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a <em>single rock</em> and weighs around <strong>80 tons</strong>. There is a big statue of <cite>Nandi</cite>(sacred bull), carved out of single rock  measuring about <em>16 feet long</em> and <em>13 feet high</em>  at the entrance. The entire temple structure is made out of <cite>granite</cite>, the nearest sources of which are about 60km to the west of temple.
